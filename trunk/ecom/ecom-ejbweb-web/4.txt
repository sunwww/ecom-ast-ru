ust as i thought it was goin alright
I found out how wrong when i thought i was right
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
I could say day, and youd say night
Tell me its black when i know thats its white
Its always the same its just a shame thats all

I could leave but i wont go, though my heart might tell me so
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me lookin at you and you lookin at me
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Turnin me on, turnin me off
Makin me feel like i want too much
Leavin with you is justa puttin me through it all of the time

Runnin around stayin out all night
Takin it all stead of takin one fight
Livin with you is justa puttin me through it all the time

I could leave but i wont go
But itd be easier i know
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes

Why does it always seem to be
Me lookin at you, you lookin at me
Its always the same its just a shame thats all

Just cause i love you, more then i wanted to
Theres no point in trying to pretend
Theres been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together til the end

I could leave but i wont go
It would be easier i know
I cant feel a thing from my head down to my toes

So why does it always seem to be
Me lookin at you, you lookin at me
Its always the same its just a shame thats all

But i love you, more then i wanted to
Theres no point in trying to pretend
Theres been no one who makes me feel like you do
Say we'll be together til the end

But just as i thought it was goin alright
I found out along i when thought i was right
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Well i can say day, youd say night
Tell me its black when i know that its white
Its always the same its just a shame thats all
Thats all

~*I Love you Brandon. . . Im sorry things turned wrong for us*~
